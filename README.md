# LearnBlazor
This is a sandbox for learning Blazor

MVC app demonstrates how to serve Blazor components in cshtml razor pages through MVC routing.
This is a use case when refactoring an existing MVC application to Blazor as a first step,
before refactoring MVC controllers to Blazor routing.

A common issue is legacy code base controllers may be very bloated, even containing business logic or database access that has to be refactored to a service interface before deprecating MVC controllers.
